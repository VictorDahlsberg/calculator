# How to run
Clone this repo and enter the following command in a terminal:

`Python3 calculator.py`

or

`Python3 calculator.py "file path"` e.g. `Python3 calculator.py "examples/example1.txt"`
to use file as input.

# Assumptions about assignment
- I assumed that the caculator should be able to handle floats, even though it wasn't a requirement in the instructions. 
- The instructions did not specify how to handle circular logic (see circular_example.txt). The program notifies the user and quits if it encounters this.
- If a register is not expiclitly given a value it will be assumed to have the value 0.
